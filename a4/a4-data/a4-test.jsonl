{"sentence": "The prevalence of discrimination across racial groups in contemporary America :"}
{"sentence": "Results from a nationally representative sample of adults"}
{"sentence": "Introduction ."}
{"sentence": "Personal experiences of discrimination and bias have been the focus of much social science research . [ 1 - 3 ]"}
{"sentence": "Sociologists have explored the adverse consequences of discrimination [ 3 – 5 ] ;"}
{"sentence": "psychologists have examined the mental processes that underpin conscious and unconscious biases [ 6 ] ;"}
{"sentence": "neuroscientists have examined the neurobiological underpinnings of discrimination [ 7 – 9 ] ;"}
{"sentence": "and evolutionary theorists have explored the various ways that in-group / out-group biases emerged across the history of our species . [ 10 ]"}
{"sentence": "In many respects , researchers already possess a wealth of knowledge concerning the origins and consequences of discrimination and bias . [ 11 ]"}
{"sentence": "What also should not be lost in discussion of discrimination is the growing push to implement social policy aimed at reducing the occurrence of discriminatory practices ."}
{"sentence": "Mandatory diversity trainings in professional settings , for example , are intended to reduce bias in the workplace by increasing the awareness of employees regarding the challenges facing minority group members . [ 12 ]"}
{"sentence": "Indeed , the implementation of certain policies is rooted in the assumption that discrimination and biases are , at least to some appreciable amount , present in modern society ."}
{"sentence": "Even so , estimates of the prevalence of perceived discrimination remains rare ( see [ 13 – 14 ] ) ."}
{"sentence": "At least one prior study by Kessler and colleagues [ 15 ] , however , using measures of perceived discrimination in a large American sample , reported that approximately 33 % of respondents reported some form of discrimination ( see also , Gibbons et al. [ 4 ] ) ."}
{"sentence": "The current study seeks to build on this research by estimating the prevalence of discrimination experiences among a large , nationally representative sample of adults from the United States ."}
{"sentence": "Additionally , the analysis address the perceived reasons for reported discrimination experiences ."}
{"sentence": "Reason for discrimination ."}
{"sentence": "All respondents who indicated they were discriminated against — specifically , those who responded with sometimes or often to the perceived discrimination measure described above — were asked the following question :"}
{"sentence": "“ What do you think was the main reason for these experiences ? ”"}
{"sentence": "Respondents were allowed to choose one response from 11 categories ."}
{"sentence": "For the present analysis , these responses were recoded into nine mutually exclusive categories capturing the following options :"}
{"sentence": "race / ancestry / skin color ;"}
{"sentence": "gender ;"}
{"sentence": "age ;"}
{"sentence": "religion ;"}
{"sentence": "height or weight ;"}
{"sentence": "sexual orientation ;"}
{"sentence": "education or income ;"}
{"sentence": "physical disability ;"}
{"sentence": "and other ."}
{"sentence": "The following categories from the original questionnaire were collapsed into one category for the analysis : race ; ancestry or national origin ; and shade of skin color ."}
{"sentence": "Additionally , because this question was only asked of respondents who reported prior discrimination experiences , the built-in skip pattern resulted in a large number of cases scored as missing ( legitimate skip ) ."}
{"sentence": "Respondent race ."}
{"sentence": "Because a race variable is not available from the Wave 4 interviews , we use the racial category reported by the respondent during the Wave 1 interview ."}
{"sentence": "Wave 1 race — rather than , say , Wave 3 race — was used to preserve case counts ."}
{"sentence": "The logic is that ( nearly ) all Wave 4 respondents appeared in the Wave 1 sample , but not all would have been interviewed at Wave 3 due to differential patterns of temporary attrition ."}
{"sentence": "Respondents were asked to indicate their race from among the following categories : White ; Black or African American ; Hispanic ; American Indian or Native American ; and Asian or Pacific Islander ."}
{"sentence": "Respondents were provided the opportunity to select more than one race , and those who did were asked a follow-up question regarding which category best described their racial background ."}
{"sentence": "In the current study , those respondents who indicated more than one race were coded as “ mixed race ” ."}
{"sentence": "Demographic variables ."}
{"sentence": "To provide information on the analytical sample as a whole , two additional demographic variables are included ."}
{"sentence": "First , age is a continuous measure created by subtracting the year of the respondents ' birth ( obtained from Wave 1 ) from the year of the interview at Wave 4 ."}
{"sentence": "Second , sex was dichotomously coded based on the self-reported sex of the respondent at Wave 4 ( 0 = female and 1 = male ) ."}
{"sentence": "Analytical plan ."}
{"sentence": "Our exploratory study included three basic steps ."}
{"sentence": "First , summary statistics of the study variables and racial categories were produced ."}
{"sentence": "Second , we examined the relative proportions of the two discrimination experience measures across each racial category ."}
{"sentence": "Finally , we assessed the distribution of reported reasons for discrimination across the racial categories ."}
{"sentence": "In order to examine potential bivariate associations , the adjusted F statistic ( design-based F ) was employed as it corrects for a complex sample design such as that used in the Add Health . [ 21 ]"}
{"sentence": "More specifically , when analyzing weighted sample data employing the svy suite of commands in Stata the conventional Pearson χ2 statistic test of independence is converted into “ an F statistic with noninteger degrees of freedom by using a second-order Rao and Scott ( 1981 [ 22 ] , 1984 [ 23 ] ) correction ” . [ 24 ]"}
{"sentence": "The p-value associated with the design-based F is thus more accurate ( than the associated with the χ2 statistic ) given the adjustments and calculations take into account the weighted nature of the data ."}
{"sentence": "This final step also included an examination of the relative distribution of racial categories across the various reported reasons for discrimination ."}
{"sentence": "As noted earlier , all analyses were weighted according to the survey weight provided by the Add Health research staff and standard errors were corrected for the clustering and stratification that defined the sampling strategy ."}
{"sentence": "Thus , all estimates reported here can be considered nationally representative of the United States ."}
{"sentence": "Otto Jespersen"}
{"sentence": "Jens Otto Harry Jespersen or Otto Jespersen ( Danish : [ ʌtˢo ˈjɛsb̥ɐsn̩ ] ; 16 July 1860 – 30 April 1943 ) was a Danish linguist who specialized in the grammar of the English language ."}
{"sentence": "Early life"}
{"sentence": "Otto Jespersen was born in Randers in Jutland ."}
{"sentence": "He was inspired by the work of Danish philologist Rasmus Rask as a boy , and with the help of Rask 's grammars taught himself some Icelandic , Italian , and Spanish ."}
{"sentence": "He entered the University of Copenhagen in 1877 when he was 17 , initially studying law but not forgetting his language studies ."}
{"sentence": "In 1881 he shifted his focus completely to languages , and in 1887 earned his master 's degree in French , with English and Latin as his secondary languages ."}
{"sentence": "He supported himself during his studies through part-time work as a schoolteacher and as a shorthand reporter in the Danish parliament ."}
{"sentence": "In 1887 – 1888 , he traveled to England , Germany and France , meeting linguists like Henry Sweet and Paul Passy and attending lectures at institutions like Oxford University ."}
{"sentence": "Following the advice of his mentor Vilhelm Thomsen , he returned to Copenhagen in August 1888 and began work on his doctoral dissertation on the English case system ."}
{"sentence": "He successfully defended his dissertation in 1891 ."}
{"sentence": "Academic life and work"}
{"sentence": "Jespersen was a professor of English at the University of Copenhagen from 1893 to 1925 , and served as Rector of the university in 1920 – 21 ."}
{"sentence": "His early work focused primarily on language teaching reform and on phonetics , but he is best known for his later work on syntax and on language development ."}
{"sentence": "He advanced the theories of Rank and Nexus in Danish in two papers : Sprogets logik ( 1913 ) and De to hovedarter af grammatiske forbindelser ( 1921 ) ."}
{"sentence": "Jespersen in this theory of ranks removes the parts of speech from the syntax , and differentiates between primaries , secondaries , and tertiaries ; e.g. in \" well honed phrase , \" \" phrase \" is a primary , this being defined by a secondary , \" honed \" , which again is defined by a tertiary \" well \" ."}
{"sentence": "The term Nexus is applied to sentences , structures similar to sentences and sentences in formation , in which two concepts are expressed in one unit ; e.g. , it rained , he ran indoors ."}
{"sentence": "This term is qualified by a further concept called a junction which represents one idea , expressed by means of two or more elements , whereas a nexus combines two ideas ."}
{"sentence": "Junction and nexus proved valuable in bringing the concept of context to the forefront of the attention of the world of linguistics ."}
{"sentence": "He was most widely recognized for some of his books ."}
{"sentence": "Language : Its Nature , Development and Origin ( 1922 ) is considered by many to be his masterpiece ."}
{"sentence": "Modern English Grammar on Historical Principles ( 1909 – 1949 ) , concentrated on morphology and syntax , and Growth and Structure of the English Language ( 1905 ) is a comprehensive view of English by someone with another native language , and still in print , over 70 years after his death and more than 100 years after publication ."}
{"sentence": "Late in his life he published Analytic Syntax ( 1937 ) , in which he presents his views on syntactic structure using an idiosyncratic shorthand notation ."}
{"sentence": "In The Philosophy of Grammar ( 1924 ) he challenged the accepted views of common concepts in Grammar and proposed corrections to the basic definitions of grammatical case , pronoun , object , voice etc. , and developed further his notions of Rank and Nexus ."}
{"sentence": "In the 21st century this book is still used as one of the basic texts in modern Structural linguistics ."}
{"sentence": "Mankind , Nation and Individual : from a linguistic point of view ( 1925 ) is one of the pioneering works on Sociolinguistics ."}
{"sentence": "Jespersen visited the United States twice :"}
{"sentence": "he lectured at the Congress of Arts and Sciences in St. Louis in 1904 , and in 1909 – 1910 he visited both the University of California and Columbia University ."}
{"sentence": "While in the U.S. , he took occasion to study the country 's educational system ."}
{"sentence": "His autobiography ( see below ) was published in English translation as recently as 1995 ."}
{"sentence": "Jespersen was a proponent of phonosemanticism and wrote :"}
{"sentence": "“ Is there really much more logic in the opposite extreme which denies any kind of sound symbolism ( apart from the small class of evident echoisms and ‘ onomatopoeia ’ ) and sees in our words only a collection of accidental and irrational associations of sound and meaning ? ..."}
{"sentence": "There is no denying that there are words which we feel instinctively to be adequate to express the ideas they stand for . ”"}
{"sentence": "After his retirement in 1925 , Jespersen remained active in the international linguistic community ."}
{"sentence": "In addition to continuing to write , he convened and chaired the first International Meeting on Linguistic Research in Geneva in 1930 , and acted as president of the Fourth International Congress of Linguists in Copenhagen in 1936 ."}
{"sentence": "Jespersen was an important figure in the international language movement ."}
{"sentence": "He was an early supporter of the Esperanto offshoot Ido and in 1927 published his own project Novial ."}
{"sentence": "He also worked with the International Auxiliary Language Association ."}
{"sentence": "Jespersen received honorary degrees from Columbia University in New York ( 1910 ) , St. Andrews University in Scotland ( 1925 ) , and the Sorbonne in Paris ( 1927 ) ."}
{"sentence": "He was one of the first six international scholars to be elected as honorary members of the Linguistic Society of America ."}

{"sentence": "Someone ’s hung it up here — a hundred meters of clean gray and green twentieth-century modernism , plucked up from the river Main and suspended in the chilly air 2,360 meters up , between a lump of wooded parkland and a cluster of antique subway cars ."}
{"sentence": "She ’s wearing a 1950s sundress and a broad-brimmed hat , and it ’s like an essay on the last century — the austere steel bridge , the bright blobs of subway graffiti , and her yellow dress , flapping against her legs as she climbs over the bridge ’s rail ."}

{"sentence": "“ Fucking airsurfers , ” says Derya ."}
{"sentence": "He steps off the moving sidewalk near you : tall , hook-nosed , the fashionable whorls of pox and acne making constellations of his cheeks and chest ; the glowing , formal tattoos of his committees and lifebrands adorning his massive triceps ."}
{"sentence": "You swallow on a dry throat ."}
{"sentence": "Derya , of all people , hearing you scream !"}
{"sentence": "He gives you a hooded look ."}

{"sentence": "Now the mites are finally closing in ."}

{"sentence": "My Presidential qualifications are rooted in my service as an Officer in the United States Air Force ."}
{"sentence": "I took the Oath to our Constitution at 22 years old ."}
{"sentence": "I understood it was an Oath to ALL of our people ."}
{"sentence": "Politicians profess an Oath to this nation but once in office pursue their party agenda and reward their voters ."}

{"sentence": "Why run for president ?"}
{"sentence": "Why not run for a lower office that you would be more likely to win and effect change ?"}
{"sentence": "When I was a young man in Air Force ROTC I was chosen to attend a unique Pilot Training Program called Euro- NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training ."}
{"sentence": "The Air Force only selected 180 Officers a year from the Academy , Squadron Officer School and ROTC to attend ."}
{"sentence": "I volunteered for that program because I knew I wanted to be a Fighter Pilot and at the \" Top of the Spear . \""}
{"sentence": "In those days it was all or nothing ."}

{"sentence": "All or nothing ."}
{"sentence": "I never wanted to make politics a career ."}
{"sentence": "Why did you choose to run in the Republican Party ?"}
{"sentence": "My ties to the Republican party date back to 1979 , when I volunteered for Ronald Reagan and his campaign in New Hampshire ."}
{"sentence": "In those days I believed there was a difference in the parties ."}
{"sentence": "Today , like many Americans , I am skeptical ."}

{"sentence": "Saturday , October 19 , 2013"}
{"sentence": "Attorney Robert Sarvis , the Libertarian Party 's nominee for Governor of Virginia , answered five questions submitted via e-mail by accredited Wikinews reporter William Saturn ."}
{"sentence": "Sarvis has garnered double digits in opinion polls for the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial election , an unusual feat for a third party candidate ."}
{"sentence": "The latest Newsmax / Zogby poll from late September placed him at 13 percent , 14 points behind Republican Party nominee Ken Cuccinelli , Virginia 's Attorney General , and 19 points behind Democratic Party nominee Terry McAuliffe , the former Democratic National Committee chairman , with 24 percent undecided ."}
{"sentence": "Whoever wins election on November 5 , 2013 , would replace outgoing governor Bob McDonnell ."}
{"sentence": "On his campaign website , Sarvis notes he favors parental school choice through student vouchers , simplification of Virginia 's Tax Code , US Second Amendment - gun - rights , same-sex marriage , and reform of the state 's drug laws ."}
{"sentence": "With Wikinews , Sarvis discusses his background , views on McDonnell 's tenure , keys to campaign success , plan to implement his agenda , and the former Virginia governor he most admires ."}
{"sentence": "Interview"}
{"sentence": "What is the most important aspect of your background that voters should know about ?"}
{"sentence": "I am the only candidate born and raised in Virginia , but also the only candidate who embodies both physically and philosophically the growing diversity of the commonwealth ."}
{"sentence": "( I am mixed-race ( half-Chinese ) and in an interracial marriage . )"}
{"sentence": "I am the only candidate who has studied both economics and law , and the only candidate with a background in technology entrepreneurship ."}
{"sentence": "Because of my academic and professional background , I understand the issues and challenges facing Virginia much better than the other candidates , and I am offering real solutions that can be appreciated across the political spectrum ."}
{"sentence": "I am the only candidate who believes in both economic freedom and personal liberty and the only candidate who stands on principle against cronyism and corporatism and in favor of the rule of law ."}
{"sentence": "What are your thoughts on the job Bob McDonnell has done as Governor of Virginia ?"}
{"sentence": "What would you have done differently than him ?"}
{"sentence": "McDonnell did well early in his term pushing back against Senate Democrats who wanted huge tax increases in response to major revenue shortfalls during the recession ."}
{"sentence": "Those early budget efforts are his highest achievements as Governor ."}
{"sentence": "More recently , he erred in accepting a transportation bill that had huge flaws and huge tax increases , rather than prioritizing spending and seeking more rational , efficient , decentralized transportation decision-making ."}
{"sentence": "He could have shown much greater leadership in pushing for tax reform , regulatory reform , and school choice ."}
{"sentence": "Of course , he showed ethical lapses in judgment ."}
{"sentence": "Compared to previous third party candidates at the gubernatorial level , you have done exceptionally well in opinion polling ."}
{"sentence": "What do you attribute that success to ?"}
{"sentence": "Voters see the two-party system for the sham it has become ."}
{"sentence": "They are sick of the partisanship and nonsense and the total lack of substance in modern campaigns ."}
{"sentence": "Voters see the two major party nominees as exemplifying what is worst about their respective parties , and they want something better ."}
{"sentence": "Voters who meet me and hear me speak know that I am sincere , know that I understand the issues deeply and have workable solutions , and know that I stand on principle against cronyism and corporatism and in favor of the rule of law and the public interest ."}
{"sentence": "People like the fact that I stand for a Virginia that is both Open-minded and Open for Business ."}
{"sentence": "If elected governor , how will you be able to implement your agenda while dealing with a hostile legislature ?"}
{"sentence": "There are precedents of independent governors dealing effectively with the legislature , and indeed a wise third-party governor can have greater effectiveness than a major party governor ."}
{"sentence": "Libertarians share many policy positions with each of the major parties ."}
{"sentence": "Working together with both Republicans and Democrats , we can get the good aspects of each party while rejecting the bad parts of both ."}
{"sentence": "Moreover , electing a third-party governor represents a repudiation of politics as usual , and the major party legislators will face changed constraints and incentives , meaning that much more is possible than many people assume , especially with strong leadership ."}
{"sentence": "Which previous Virginia Governor(s) do you most admire and why ?"}
{"sentence": "Thomas Jefferson ."}
{"sentence": "He was incredibly learned and was a strong advocate for freedom and the rule of law ."}
{"sentence": "He would be a Libertarian today ."}

{"sentence": "Interview with LibriVox founder Hugh McGuire"}
{"sentence": "Sunday , May 28 , 2006"}
{"sentence": "The LibriVox website features a catalog of about a hundred completed books , including books in other languages like German , Hebrew , and Japanese ."}
{"sentence": "Why did you decide to take the acoustic fate of public domain works into your own hands , and how did you go about it ?"}
{"sentence": "I think that a vibrant public domain is very important to a healthy world , and so I thought : here 's a way to help the cause ."}
{"sentence": "I launched LibriVox , emailed some friends and some podcasters who where doing literary stuff , and invited them to record a chapter of Joseph Conrad 's Secret Agent ."}
{"sentence": "Things have grown steadily since ."}
{"sentence": "By the way , AKMA was the first guy I know of to do something like this , with Lawrence Lessig 's Free Culture ."}
{"sentence": "That , I think , started my thinking about this , but it took a while for the idea to crystallize ."}
{"sentence": "Hugh McGuire with some books that have not yet been acoustically liberated ."}
{"sentence": "Do you personally record audiobooks , and did you already do so before LibriVox ?"}
{"sentence": "LibriVox was my first experience recording audiobooks ."}
{"sentence": "I still do the odd chapter , but i am a bit delinquent in finishing some of them these days !"}
{"sentence": "Is there a particular LibriVox book which you think stands out because of the quality , the overall effort involved , its popularity , or for some other reason ?"}
{"sentence": "My personal favourite is Notes from the Underground ( Dostoyevsky ) ."}
{"sentence": "Other random good ones :"}
{"sentence": "Austen , Jane ."}
{"sentence": "Pride and Prejudice"}
{"sentence": "Christie , Agatha ."}
{"sentence": "The Mysterious Affair at Styles"}
{"sentence": "London , Jack ."}

{"sentence": "Twain , Mark ."}
{"sentence": "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court ( solo )"}
{"sentence": "Ed. : See the LibriVox catalog for a full index ."}
{"sentence": "Browsing the catalog , I find that the quality of the spoken audio varies greatly from text to text or even from chapter to chapter ."}
{"sentence": "If someone wanted to re-record a chapter because they did n't like the speaker , would you then offer two versions ?"}
{"sentence": "Yes ."}
{"sentence": "We take the Wikipedia approach : if you think it should be better , please help it be so ."}
{"sentence": "You 'll note we offer a couple of versions of some books ."}
{"sentence": "Indeed our weekly poetry project celebrates this diversity of voice : each week a new short poem is chosen and as many readers as wish to record a version , so you get 20 + versions of the same poem , a very interesting audio experience ."}
{"sentence": "Besides works whose copyright has expired , there is an increasing number of modern books available under Creative Commons and similar licenses ."}
{"sentence": "You mentioned Larry Lessig 's Free Culture , but it also includes some out of print titles by publishers who are open to the concept , such as O'Reilly ."}
{"sentence": "Do you want to limit the scope of LibriVox strictly to old public domain works , or do you have plans to include recent works under reasonably permissive licenses as well ?"}
{"sentence": "We are only doing public domain works , for a number of reasons , partly to keep simplicity in our copyright situation -- public domain means it s as simple as can be ."}
{"sentence": "CC makes things more complex ."}
