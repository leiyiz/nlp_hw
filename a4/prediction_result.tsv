What also should not be lost in discussion of discrimination is the growing push to implement social policy aimed at reducing the occurrence of discriminatory practices .	PRON ADV AUX PRON AUX VERB ADP NOUN ADP NOUN AUX DET ADJ NOUN PART VERB ADJ NOUN VERB SCONJ VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT
Mandatory diversity trainings in professional settings , for example , are intended to reduce bias in the workplace by increasing the awareness of employees regarding the challenges facing minority group members .

More specifically , when analyzing weighted sample data employing the svy suite of commands in Stata the conventional Pearson χ2 statistic test of independence is converted into “ an F statistic with noninteger degrees of freedom by using a second-order Rao and Scott ( 1981 [ 22 ] , 1984 [ 23 ] ) correction ” .

Jespersen in this theory of ranks removes the parts of speech from the syntax , and differentiates between primaries , secondaries , and tertiaries ; e.g. in " well honed phrase , " " phrase " is a primary , this being defined by a secondary , " honed " , which again is defined by a tertiary " well " .
